      <h2>About J. Rose</h2>
        <p>
          Just a short, sad, black woman who likes music, coding and dance.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          I currently live in the Pacific Northwest area, US, although I was born in Texas.
          I am 22yrs old and am working towards getting a certificate in software development with Code Fellows.
          Before Code Fellows, I was at the University of Washington, then Washington State University, then the University of Texas.
          My goal is to become a software developer in mobile and web development, and so far I have coding experience in 
          Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, SQL, R and Python. My technical skills are React, Node.js and Vuejs.
          I also love dance and watching TV shows, and I'm a huge phone geek... and I have a stuffed cow named Tipsy.

        <!-- <p class="disclaimer">
          This website is not for professional purposes or popularity or anything, I made it as a way to express myself and to keep my interests organized. I don't really have a best friend
          who I can talk about personal things with or bond about similar interests with, so I would write down things that I wanted to say to someone who I haven't met yet. It can
          be hard for me to always be myself because of my anxiety and lack of confidence, but one of the qualities I really value in people is genuity (idk if that's a word). I feel more
          comfortable around people when they are not afraid to be themselves so I try to be that way myself. This site is a place I feel I can be honest and can direct it to
          anyone if they want to (or if I want them to) know about me and not just the reserved me that I typically show that tries to make everything into a joke because I've have had
          bad experiences with trying to open up to people in the past. As much as I like making people laugh and smile, I'm pretty messed up on the inside and often I feel like my humor
          is the only way I can get people to notice me. So this site is more of a true expression and I love to code too that's also why I made it. :p
          I'm not expecting much eyes on this site other than my own, but if you're not me,
          welcome to my website. Pls don't hate me or abandon me ever cus I'm a lonely lass :/ and I'm a loyal, nonjudgmental and accepting friend and I feel like that's rare to come by ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
